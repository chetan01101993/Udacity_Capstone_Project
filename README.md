# Udacity_Capstone_Project

# Introduction
This is the final project of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program.

As the COVID-19 keeps unleashing its havoc, the world continues to get pushed into the crisis of the great economic recession, more and more companies start to cut down their underperforming employees. Companies firing hundreds and thousands of Employees is a typical headline today. Cutting down employees or reducing an employee salary is a tough decision to take. It needs to be taken with utmost care as imprecision in the identification of employees whose performance is attriting may lead to sabotaging of both employees' career and the company's reputation in the market.

The goal of this project is to predict the employee attrition by the given data about his/her past history.
